Bitcoins have proved to be a suitable alternative to existing financial systems where people from all across the world have adopted this new currency and have already made millions out of it.

                The first Bitcoin Transaction was made on the 12th Jan 2009 from Satoshi to Hal Finney.<br />
                To get a glimpse of the growth of Bitcoins we might start with the fact that it started as:<br />
                 $1 = 1,309.03 BTC<br />
                And now it is:<br />

                As the stats portray, the growth of Bitcoins has been massive and it has made a huge impact on various financial systems all across the globe. <br />
                The usability of Bitcoins increased gradually with the passing years and by the end of 2011, people had started buying things as expensive as a vehicle using this innovative pseudo-currency.
                By 2016, Bitcoin has passed numerous milestones which clearly highlight how widely the concept has been accepted and where its heading towards.<sup><a class="visible" href="usability.html#27">(27)</a></sup>

                These days you won't have any problems spending your bitcoins. You can book flights, buy apartments and eat and drink your way through most of the world's major cities. But three years ago things were different. Then you had to fly to Berlin and make your way to a small bar in the city’s Kreuzberg district if you wanted to spend bitcoins. Room 77 in the German capital is celebrating five years of accepting the crypto-currency.  The exact date is not really clear but the owner of the bar, Joerg Platzer, approximated that it was around May 2011 that he accepted the first bitcoin transaction for a beer.

                            Things have changed dramatically since then. Bitcoin has seen highs and lows, it has beenembraced by many and discredited by others but it has continued its march towards global recognition. Back then, Platzer explained, he was happy if he had one or two bitcoin purchases per month; now he has up to 10 purchases per evening.

                Back then people would turn up with their laptops and manually type in the address codes to make transactions; now young hipsters show up with their smartphones and make transactions like it’s the easiest thing in the world. <br />
                Back then Platzer would be ecstatic if four people showed up to a bitcoin meetup; now his bar fills up on the first Thursday of every month when the local enthusiasts meet.

                Platzer described himself as an old-school 'hacker, lock picker and phreak'. In his circles there was talk of a decentralized digital currency for years, and when he heard about bitcoin for the first time he knew he was on to something big.<sup><a class="visible" href="usability.html#18">(18)</a>, <a class="visible" href="usability.html#26">(26)</a></sup>
