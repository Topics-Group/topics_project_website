            <h2>What is a Transaction?</h2>
            
            <p>
                In the Bitcoin system, all BTC are exchanged through transactions. Every transaction has inputs and outputs. All inputs to a transaction must be unspent outputs from other transactions (UTXOs, or “Unspent Transaction Outputs). This means that technically no-one owns BTC, rather they have access to outputs with BTC values. For example, if a person only has access to a UTXO with 3BTC, they can’t create a transaction which uses 2.5BTC as its input.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Each transaction contains certain data. All transactions contain their “hash”, i.e. the hashed value of all the other data. This hash is used to refer to each transaction, as the “transaction ID” (or TXID). Transactions also contain other metadata:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The version number of the Bitcoin software (so that each transaction is only processed according to the protocol when it was created)</li>
                <li>The number of inputs</li>
                <li>The number of outputs</li>
                <li>The locktime (described in verification)</li>
                <li>The transaction’s size in Bytes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="img"><img width= 900vw src="/Resources/Images/Bitcoin%20TX%20Example.png" /></p>
            
            <p>
                Transactions also include data on inputs and outputs. Each output from a transaction contains its value in BTC, and a script. If a user can provide data for the script to evaluate to true, then the user is able to use this output (i.e. treated as its owner). This means that only the owner of an output can spend it in a transaction (this is explained in depth in the verification section).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the transaction’s data, the inputs are stored as:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The hash (TXID) of the transaction which’s output is being used as an input</li>
                <li>The index of the output being used</li>
                <li>The data required to prove ownership of the output</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Outputs are stored as:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The value of the output in BTC</li>
                <li>The script required for verification of ownership of the output</li>
            </ul>
            
            <a class="anchor" name="Transaction_Fees"></a>
            
            <h2>Transaction Fees and Change</h2>
            
            <p>
                For a transaction to be processed by miners, it must pay a minimum transaction fee. Transactions which pay a higher fee and transactions which spend older outputs will be processed with higher priority. Any miner which adds the transaction to the block chain can claim the transaction fee, so paying a higher transaction fee gives miners more incentive to process your transaction.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Transaction fees are typically proportionate to the size of the transaction in bytes, as larger transactions require more computation from the miner (so a higher incentive is needed to process them). There is a minimum transaction fee off 1000 Satoshis (0.00001BTC). Transaction fees are calculated as the difference between the outputs and the inputs of the transaction (outputs must be greater than inputs or the transaction is invalid).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If a user can’t pay the exact amount required using only their outputs, they can reclaim the change. For example, if a user has an output of 2BTC and wants to spend 1BTC (ignoring transaction fees), they can reclaim the change from this transaction by using the whole 2BTC as an input, and then sending one output of 1BTC to the recipient, and 1BTC back to the sender. The 1BTC sent back to the spender is the “change” of the transaction.
            </p>

            <h2>Validation</h2>
            
            <p>
                After a user makes a transaction, they must broadcast it to the P2P network. Each node will check that the transaction is valid before broadcasting it, and miners will check this before adding the transaction to the block chain. The nodes check:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>If the transaction is only spending UTXOs (i.e. not re-using outputs)</li>
                <li>That the transaction is a “standard transaction” (explained more in the verification section)</li>
                <li>That the spender owns the outputs they are spending (explained more in the verification section)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                After the nodes check that a transaction is valid, they will broadcast it to other nodes and/or add it to the list of transactions they’ll add to the block chain (if the nodes are miners).
            </p>
            
            <a class="anchor" name="Coinbase_Transactions"></a>
            
            <h2>Coinbase Transactions</h2>
            
            <p>
                Coinbase transactions are a special kind of transaction. When a new block is created and added to the blockchain, it will contain a Coinbase transaction (also called a generation transaction). This transaction is used to reward the user who created the block with BTC, and uses the Coinbase as its input (effectively creating new coins). The miner who creates the block can decide where the transaction is output, but most miners collect the Coinbase transaction.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If two miners create a block within a small period of time, they can each attempt to collect the Coinbase transaction in their respective block chains. This is avoided as the block chain is self-correcting, and any forks will be removed by the network (i.e. only one of the miners’ blocks will actually be included in the block chain). The Coinbase transaction can only be spent 100 blocks after it is created, preventing two or more miners from collecting it before the block chain corrects itself.
            </p>
